# T41-EP SDT Project Files

Hardware and software files for the T41-EP SDT as sold / distributed by [AI6YM](https://ai6ym.radio/t41-ep-sdt). These files are branched from [K9HZ's Repo](https://github.com/DRWJSCHMIDT/T41) and [G0ORX's Repo](https://github.com/g0orx/T41-EP) with some files from the [SoftwareControlledHamRadio Groups.IO](https://groups.io/g/SoftwareControlledHamRadio).

Changes present here are minor modifications made to enable automated SMD assembly, pre-programming of the Teensy and ATTiny, etc. Refinements to various BOMs (bill of materials) have been made to substitute parts which are unavailable or correct errors.
